MyGallery
=========

An alternate gallery to fill in my needs

So far this "Gallery" only presents the "Buckets" from android's images content provider. 
Each bucket is assigned a cover, a name and a total count of images.
The cover consists of a crop section of the first image from the bucket with a small thumbnail 

The intention about this galleries is that the normal galleries will be the buckets from the provider while there will be two other type of galleries, one consisting of references to various images from bucket galleries and the second one consisting of search queries results.
all back up to db, and in the case of the queries, probably updated somehow sometime...

Currently, it can only list the buckts on external storage. Each bucket is represented by a view composed of an Image view and a Text view.
The text view displays the bucket/gallery name and the number of images contained in it.
The Bitmap is generated by a Cover sub class SimpleCover which generates a crop of the first image found in the buckt, blurred and whitened with a small thumbnail on its upper left corner.

This bitmap is saved to a jpg image for future runs
